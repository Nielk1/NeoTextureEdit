NeoTextureEdit2
===============

This project is a fork of the NeoTextureEdit project, which has seemingly been abandonen/forgotten by its creators.
NeoTextureEdit2 is an attempt to improve NeoTextureEdit. Currently, the only improvement that has been
implementeed thus far is:

- Instead of using JFileChooser for choosing files, FileDialog is now used instead. Because quite frankly,
JFileChooser is fucking terrible to use.

How to use the program
===============
=======
NeoTexture Library.
===================

The NeoTexture Library can be used to load a texture graph generated
by NeoTextureEdit and create the according textures at runtime.


License.
========

NeoTextureEdit and the runtime generation library NeoTexture are
licensed under the GNU LGPL v.3. See the files COPYING and 
COPYING.LESSER for details. 


Dependencies.
=============

NeoTextureEdit needs a Java 1.6 compliant runtime environment.  For
OpenGL preview rendering a graphics card with shader support is
needed.


Notes.
======

To learn the usage of the editor you can look at the provided example
textures in the examples directory.

NeoTextureEdit saves its settings on exit in a file called
'TextureEdtiorSettings'.  This file will be saved in the directory
from where you start the editor.  This file also contains your pattern
presets. Deleting this file resets to the factory settings.



Running NeoTextureEdit:
=======================

Linux: Use the provided shell script in the main directory to run
       NeoTextureEdit.

Windows: Use the provided executable to start.

MacOS: The application can be started via double-click in the finder.

In the OpenGL preview pane(the bottommost panel), you can zoom in and out by holding in the shift key and the left mouse button and then moving around the mouse.

In the Texture Graph panel(the centremost panel), you can move around by holding the middle mouse button and 
moving the mouse. If you are using a laptop and don't have a middle mouse button, you can instead hold down
the control key and the left mouse button, and then move around the mouse.
